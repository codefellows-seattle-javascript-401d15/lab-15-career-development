# Description:

### For this lab, we were to create a pure method for `pop()`, `peek()` and `dequeue()` so that in the future when we are creating Stacks and Queues we will understand what the methods that are given for these D.A. can be used and know what they are doing. We were also supposed to create a function that will iterate through an array of data, put the opening brackets from the array into a stack then when you find the closing bracket pop it out of that stack. We are also supposed to write three tests for the 4 methods that were created by you.

# Installation and creating `package.json`:

### Creating `package.json`:

`npm init` will start the process of creating a package json then you go through the list of different things to create it. Fairly easy process, but when you get to the tests part you need to put mocha so that when you run `npm run test` in your terminal you will be able to.

### mocha:

in terminal put `npm i -D mocha` and it will install into your node packages.

### chai:

in terminal put `npm i -D chai` and it will install into your node packages.

### eslint:

Eslint will go through your code and see if there is any problems with your code grammically. It was installed to make sure that no problems were presented that will brake your code. to install it it is `npm i -D eslint`.
